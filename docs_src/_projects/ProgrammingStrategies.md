short_desc: Developers solve problems by applying programming strategies, describing sequences of steps to debug, reuse, design, test, and understand code. Experienced developers work better by using more effective strategies. We've been exploring ways to capture and make explicit the strategies developers use, helping uncover how developers work differently and to create new ways to help developers benefit from the hard-earned wisdom of experienced developers.
