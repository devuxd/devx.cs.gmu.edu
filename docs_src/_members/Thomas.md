I study how humans interact with code and design new ways to build software. 
I work at the intersection of software engineering and human-computer interaction.

I use behavioral methods to study developers as users of their programming tools, 
understand what makes designing, implementing, and debugging software hard, 
and re-envision the relationship between developers and code. 
A key focus of my work has been designing new techniques to view and manipulate code. 
I have pioneered the design of crowdsourced programming environments, 
which reify developerâ€™s design knowledge, strategies, and mental models in explicit forms 
which can be manipulated by program analysis tools and connected to code.
